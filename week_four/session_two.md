#### Binary Search Trees

## What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
    - Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
        * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
        * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
        * The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree (we can use recursion!)

## Examples of BST used in Programming
    - Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving
        - the "map" and "set" objects in many languages' libraries
    - breaks you into other concepts (Binary Space Partition, Binary Tries, etc)

## Let's Code!
    - Make a BST
    - add (iterative)
    - contains (iterative)
    - size (recursive)
